Synopsis

This code builds a real-time platform to analyze purchases within a social network of users, and detect any behavior that is far from the average within that social network.

Code Requirements

Please include two input files. One json file has past data used to build the initial state of the entire user network, as well as the purchase history of the users. Another one will be used to determine whether a purchase is anomalous. 

Motivation

Users can see which items their friends are buying, and are influenced by the purchases within their network.

Installation and Running

No installation needed. Just use run.sh file. Please change to the corresponding location of three json files. First two json files are input files and last one is the output file.

Tests

One available under the insight_testsuite folder.
